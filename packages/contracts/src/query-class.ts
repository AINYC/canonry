/**
 * BRANDED VS NON-BRAND IS THE SAME SPLIT EVERYWHERE.
 *
 * A query that names the project's own brand measures recognition: the model is
 * being asked about you, so a mention is nearly free and a competitor
 * structurally cannot earn one. A query that does not name you measures
 * competitive placement. Pooling the two into one denominator lets branded
 * recall carry a category number, which inverts the ranking it claims to show —
 * so the two never share a denominator in any metric, copy, or contract field.
 *
 * Advanced measurement reached this first and stores the class per assignment
 * (`measurementQueryClassSchema`, a re-export of this enum). Projects without a
 * measurement plan have no stored class, so read-time surfaces classify from
 * the query text with {@link compileQueryClassifier} — the SAME brand matcher,
 * never a second copy of the rules.
