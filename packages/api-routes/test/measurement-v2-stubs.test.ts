/**
 * Slice 1 registered these routes and left the bodies to the slices that own
 * each module. Those slices have landed, so nothing here answers 501 any more.
 *
 * What the file still pins is what it was written to catch, now stated in both
 * directions: every path is mounted, so a route that quietly failed to register
 * cannot hide behind a handler that was never called; and none of them has
 * regressed to a stub. A route that came back as 501 would mean a slice was
 * reverted or lost in an integration, which is exactly the failure a squashed
 * merge makes easy to miss.
