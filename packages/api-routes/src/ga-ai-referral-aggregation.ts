/**
 * CONSERVATION INVARIANT for `ga_ai_referrals`. Read this before changing any
 * aggregation in this file or adding a new read of that table.
 *
 *   SUM ACROSS LANDING PAGES WITHIN ONE ATTRIBUTION DIMENSION.
 *   NEVER SUM ACROSS DIMENSIONS.
 *
 * A stored row is one (date, source, medium, sourceDimension, channelGroup,
 * landingPage) cell, so one day of traffic from one source arrives as MANY
 * rows, each worth a handful of sessions and very often worth exactly 1 (one
 * landing page, one visit). The rows inside a single dimension are disjoint:
 * GA4 attributes exactly one landing page per session, so summing them is
 * required to get that dimension's real total.
 *
 * The dimensions are not disjoint. `session`, `first_user` and `manual_utm`
 * are three overlapping lenses on the same visit, fetched as three separate
 * GA4 reports. Only one lens may contribute to a tuple's total; this module
 * keeps the lens reporting the most sessions.
 *
 * Both ways of getting this wrong have shipped in this codebase:
 *
 *   sum every row  ->  roughly 3x inflation (three lenses counted as if they
 *                      were three disjoint groups of traffic)
 *   MAX every row  ->  collapse to a single landing page (a real 35 session
 *                      day reported as 1)
 *
 * This is the same discipline as the demand-conservation rule: the parts must
 * add up to the whole exactly once, so every derived AI session number (window
 * totals, the daily trend series, the per-source rows) is folded from the one
 * winner set produced by `resolveWinningDimensions` below. Two surfaces that
 * derive the same quantity independently will eventually disagree; two
 * surfaces that fold the same winner set cannot.
 *
 * THE COMPANION RULE FOR USERS. Everything above is about SESSIONS, and it
 * does not transfer:
 *
 *   SESSIONS sum across landing pages within a dimension.
 *   USERS DO NOT SUM AT ANY GRAIN.
 *
 * GA reports `totalUsers` as a COUNT DISTINCT evaluated at the grain the
 * report asked for. One visitor who reads three pages is ONE user, but they
 * contribute a `users` value to all three landing-page rows, so adding those
 * rows counts them three times. The same is true across mediums, channel
 * groups, sources and dates. There is no grain at which the stored `users`
 * column may be added up, which is why no surface here publishes one.
 *
 * Sessions escape this because GA4 attributes exactly one landing page to a
 * session and dates are disjoint, so the landing-page rows partition the day.
 *
 * A correct users figure requires GA to do the dedup in an un-dimensioned
 * report. `ga_daily_totals` is that fetch for whole-property traffic, but
 * there is no AI-referral equivalent: `fetchAiReferrals` is always dimensioned
 * by source/medium/landingPage/channelGroup. So an AI-referral user count
 * cannot be computed and cannot be fetched. It is therefore not reported, the
 * same call `aiReferralSectionSchema` made when it withdrew its user counts
 * and the same call `/ga/traffic` made in 4.135.0 when it withdrew its six
 * `*Users*` fields and the `users` on its two referral row types. Do not
 * reintroduce one here with a caveat: a wrong number with a caveat is still a
 * wrong number on a customer-facing surface.

 * produced two surviving rows and doubled every AI total on the report.
 *
 * Each dimension keeps its own paid vs organic split, and the winner's total is
