 * sibling — a docs host, a preview deployment, a subdomain somebody else
 * operates — could then drive real writes here, including runs that cost money.
 * Comparing the ORIGIN to this server's own host closes that, because a sibling
 * cannot forge the header.
 *
 * Only COOKIE-carried credentials are checked — including the older shared
 * dashboard password, which resolves to a wildcard key but is still a browser
 * session in every way that matters here. A key presented in an Authorization
 * header is exempt: no browser attaches one automatically, so there is nothing
 * to ride, and checking it would break every CLI and agent.
 *
 * A missing origin is refused rather than allowed — every browser sends one on a
 * write, so its absence means the request is not the browser this is written for.
