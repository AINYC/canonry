/**
 * The set of queries a project was measuring, versioned.
 *
 * Analytics has to hold its query set constant to produce a trend — a bucket
 * whose queries differ from its neighbour is not a comparison. That constraint
 * used to be enforced with `query.createdAt < bucketStart`, a proxy for "was
 * this query in the same measurement set" that is wrong in ways that cost real
 * signal:
 *
 *   - re-adding a query mints a new row, so it looks brand new and its own
 *     history detaches from it
 *   - a rename is a delete plus an add, with the same effect
 *   - eligibility shifts silently whenever bucket boundaries move
 *   - nothing anywhere recorded WHICH set was being measured
 *
 * A revision makes membership explicit. Runs are stamped with the revision that
 * was current when they started, so a comparison is like-for-like by
 * construction, and a change of basket becomes a visible event rather than an
 * inference from timestamps.
 *
 * Revisions are minted LAZILY from the live query set rather than hooked onto
 * every mutation site. Query mutations live in at least three routes today and
 * a fourth would silently skip the hook — the failure would be an unversioned
 * basket that still looks fine. Deriving from the current set has no call site
 * to forget.
