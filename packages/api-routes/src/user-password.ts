/**
 * Password storage for named accounts.
 *
 * A password is user-chosen and therefore likely reused from somewhere else, so
 * a stolen database must not be a wordlist away from every account. Storage is
 * salted scrypt with a per-password random salt, in the same self-describing
 * `scrypt$1$<salt>$<digest>` format the install already uses elsewhere, so the
 * version field leaves room to move to a stronger derivation later without
 * stranding existing accounts.
 *
 * Nothing in this module accepts a logger, and the plaintext never leaves the
 * argument it arrived in. The bearer-token path deliberately does NOT go
 * through here: those are 128-bit random tokens with no guessing exposure, and
 * they stay on the fast SHA-256 path in `auth.ts`.
