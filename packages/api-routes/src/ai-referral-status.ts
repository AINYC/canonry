/**
 * An AI referral row records a REQUEST carrying AI-origin evidence, together
 * with the status the server answered it with. Not every such request is a
 * visit, and the status is what separates them.
 *
 * A Location redirect (301/302/303/307/308) is a hop. The visitor received no
 * content at that URL; their browser was sent somewhere else, and the
 * destination raises its own row when it carries the same evidence. Counting
 * the hop as an arrival counts one person twice on any site that redirects,
 * and counts them at least once on a site whose redirect target drops the
 * evidence, where the arrival is never observed at all. On live data 126 of
 * 1,572 referral hits (8.0%) were Location redirects, and on one project every
 * single referral hit was one: 120 hops reported as 120 visitors to a site
 * whose own analytics recorded 2 sessions.
 *
 * The band is deliberately NOT all of 3xx. A 304 is a served page view from
 * cache with no follow-on request — 122 of the hits in that same measurement
 * were 304s, i.e. real returning visitors — so excluding it would drop real
 * arrivals that are recouped nowhere. See `isLocationRedirectStatus`.
 *
 * 4xx and 5xx are deliberately KEPT. Someone did arrive; they landed on a
 * broken or missing page, which is a real finding rather than a miscount, and
 * suppressing it would hide exactly the pages worth fixing.
 *
 * Status 0 is KEPT as well, on benefit of the doubt: ingest stores 0 when the
 * source never observed a status, and an unobserved status is not a proven
 * hop. The cost is that a future source which cannot capture statuses reports
 * everything as landed — which is exactly the pre-filter behaviour, not a new
 * overcount. This is why the landed figures are documented as "not answered
 * with a proven redirect" rather than "proven served".
