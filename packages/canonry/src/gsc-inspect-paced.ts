/**
 * Paced, rate-aware driver for GSC URL Inspection loops.
 *
 * Google documents two per-site limits for URL Inspection: **2000 QPD** and
 * **600 QPM** (https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools/limits). We pace
 * well under the per-minute figure — see the constants below for why. Two callers inspect URLs in a loop (`gsc-inspect-sitemap` walks the
 * whole sitemap; `gsc-sync` inspects the top pages by clicks). Both used to
 * call `inspectUrl` with no retry, so a transient quota response silently
 * marked a URL as failed and polluted the coverage snapshot.
 *
 * Quirk worth knowing: under per-minute quota pressure the endpoint returns a
 * transient 403 (PERMISSION_DENIED-shaped) rather than a 429. We therefore
 * treat 403 as a soft rate signal — retried with backoff — and rely on the
 * consecutive-failure circuit breaker below to bail fast when the property is
 * genuinely inaccessible, so a real auth/property misconfiguration does not
 * burn the daily quota grinding every URL.
 */

/**
 * Minimum spacing between successive request STARTS, across all workers.
 *
 * This is a rate control: one start per second is at most 60 QPM, an order of
 * magnitude under Google's documented 600 QPM. It is deliberately conservative
 * — the endpoint signals per-minute pressure with a transient 403 rather than
 * a 429 (see the retry predicate below), so the ceiling is not something we
 * want to probe in production.
 *
 * It is NOT a concurrency control. The two were conflated: because the loop was
 * serial, the effective rate was bounded by Google's own per-call latency
 * (~6.3s for a live index lookup) rather than by this spacing, so a site paid
 * ~7.4s per URL and got ~9.5 QPM — six times slower than this constant allows.
 * `INSPECT_MAX_CONCURRENCY` lifts that accidental cap while this figure keeps
 * the rate posture exactly where it was.

 * that range — roughly a 5x throughput gain over the serial loop, with the
 * request rate still capped by `INSPECT_BASE_DELAY_MS` and the circuit breaker
 * still watching for sustained failure.
