/**
 * Keep the skills already installed on this machine in step with the engine

 *
 * The problem this solves: `canonry skills install` copies the bundled skill
 * trees onto disk, and nothing ever re-runs it. Upgrade the engine and the
 * agent keeps reading a playbook for the previous version — it will cite a flag
 * that no longer exists, or miss a command that now does. Unlike a stale shell
 * completion, which fails loudly and harmlessly (TAB does nothing), a stale
 * playbook fails silently and confidently: the agent asserts something wrong
 * and the cost lands as a failed run.
 *
 * Why not a package-manager hook: npm's `allowScripts` is off by default and
 * a global install cannot approve scripts at all, so a `postinstall` would fail
 * hardest for exactly the people most likely to be running an agent in a
 * hardened environment. Healing on the next invocation needs no package-manager
 * cooperation, and additionally covers hand-deleted files, a partial install,
 * and a `$HOME` shared across machines — none of which a version bump implies.

 * "config present but unparsable" — it does not throw — so folding null into
 * "no version recorded, therefore changed" makes a malformed config look like
