/**
 * The ONE place a GSC index-coverage snapshot is written.
 *
 * Two runs produce coverage — `gsc-sync` and `inspect-sitemap` — and the server
 * chains the second off the first, both writing the same `(project, date)` row
 * with a delete-then-insert. When they computed it independently they drifted:
 * `gsc-sync` derived coverage across the whole property while `inspect-sitemap`
 * counted inspections alone, so the chained run silently overwrote the derived
 * figures minutes after they were written and reset the provenance columns to
 * their defaults. Same row, two meanings, last writer wins.
 *
 * Routing both through here removes the class of bug rather than the instance.
 * Callers supply only the run id; every input is read from the database, so
 * neither caller can pass a different view of the same facts.

/**

 *     GSC page   https://canonry.ai/             trailing slash
 *     inspection http://ainyc.ai/                pre-migration scheme AND host
 *
 * A raw union counts the same page two or three times and reports sitemap
 * pages as unmeasured purely because GSC spelled them differently. Keying on
 * the normalized PATH collapses scheme, host, and trailing-slash differences —
 * which is what we want here, because a project is one site and the legacy host
 * is the same pages under an old name.
 *
 * The trade: a project genuinely serving different content on two hosts would
 * have those paths merged. `canonicalDomain` is per project, so that is out of
 * scope today; revisit if multi-host projects arrive.
