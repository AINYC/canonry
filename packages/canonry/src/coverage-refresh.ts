/**
 * Minimum spacing between AUTOMATIC GSC sitemap-coverage refreshes for one
 * project.
 *
 * A successful `gsc-sync` (search performance) and `bing-inspect-sitemap`
 * (Bing's coverage sync) both chain into a full GSC `inspect-sitemap` so the
 * index-coverage dashboard (`gscUrlInspections`) doesn't go stale. The URL
 * Inspection API is quota-limited (2000 requests/property/day, ~1 request/sec),
 * so a scheduled chain skips when one already ran within this window.
 *
 * The original justification for applying this to EVERY caller was that
 * "`gsc-sync` only inspects the top 50 pages by clicks", so the full sweep was
 * a periodic top-up. That stopped being true when inline inspection was removed
 * from `gsc-sync` — it now inspects nothing at all. Skipping the sweep no
 * longer means "refresh a bit less thoroughly", it means NO URL is inspected
 * and index coverage cannot change.
 *
 * That is what a user hit: they pressed "Refresh search data" 46 minutes after the
 * daily scheduled refresh, the chain was silently skipped, and the dashboard's
 * coverage numbers were structurally incapable of moving. Nothing failed and
 * nothing said so.

 * in-flight check below is what actually dedupes those two; this window covers
 * the case where the first sweep has already finished.
