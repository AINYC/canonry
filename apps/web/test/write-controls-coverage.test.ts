/**
 * A control that changes something must not be offered to an account that
 * cannot use it.
 *
 * `viewer-write-controls.test.tsx` proves `WriteButton` behaves correctly. It
 * cannot prove the SECTIONS use it, and four of them did not: Discovery, GBP,
 * Research queries and Technical AEO each rendered a plain `Button` wired to a
 * mutation, so a viewer got an enabled control that the server was always going
 * to refuse with a 403. "Find queries" looked broken rather than forbidden.
 *
 * This is the structural check: any project section that fires a mutation must
 * route its action through `WriteButton`. It fails on the NEXT one too, which
 * is the point — the per-control test only ever covers controls someone
 * remembered to add to it.
